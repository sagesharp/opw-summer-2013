ARs:

Sarah:
 - is it ok to set DMA mask after xhci_gen_setup?
   - what about bounce buffer initialization?
 - send feedback on cmd_status patch
 - answer other questions

Xenia:
 - blog post by end of week
 - create a patchset that:
   1. Moves all instances of xhci_info to xhci_dbg, and removes xhci_info
   2. Moves all instances of printk to xhci_dbg
   3. Removes CONFIG_USB_XHCI_HCD_DEBUGGING and moves everything to dynamic debugging.
 - try making a simple change to the OPW notes git repo,
   and push to make sure you have the right permissions.
 - put questions in the git repo
 - revise cmd_status patch a bit - Sarah to send feedback.


Trace events:

End goal: have a way to turn on and off debug statements associated with one
type of xHCI command.

Start with a patch that enables a trace event for all debug statements
associated with addressing a USB device.  Start with the debug statements in
xhci_address_device() and xhci_setup_addressable_virt_dev().  I would suggest
you leave the xhci_warn statements alone.  I would like to see those warnings,
even when the trace event is off.

For other trace events, like configure endpoint, you will also find debugging
statements in the ring handling code, such as those in handle_cmd_completion().
I don't think there are any debug statement for address device commands in the
ring code, this is just for future reference.
