TODO
-----

Sarah
 - give Xenia both more tracepoints and xhci bugs.  More, more! :)
 - email Andy - try to understand his feedback on the DMA patch.

Xenia
 - debug the failure to print the context:
   - try to increase event ring buffer from debugfs - change size?
   - email Steve Rostedt and Cc linux-trace-users@vger.kernel.org, ask if this is expected behavior.

Notes
-----

when the trace context plugin is not loaded, sometimes the contexts are not
printed in dmesg.
 - sometimes prints, but only small contexts are printed.
 - for command - context is big
 - try to increase ring buffer from debugfs - change size?
   - email Steve Rostedt and cc linux-trace-users mailing list

Linux Con Europe:
 - Xenia will fly in on Oct 20th - morning - leave on 25th
