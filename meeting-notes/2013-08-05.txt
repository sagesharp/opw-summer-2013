TODO
-----

Xenia
 - send updated DMA patch to Sarah only
 - new trace event patches should be based on the last six sent to Sarah
   - i.e. should be based on [RFC v2 4/4] xhci: add xhci_cmd_completion trace event

Sarah
 - review DMA patch, see if it's what Andy wanted.
 - get trace events into usb-next

Notes
-----

transfer events - added a trace event
trace log command - make more generic?
 - new patches should be based on last six patches

endpoint is not halted - refusing to reset.
 - mass storage driver only clears the halt when the endpoint is actually halted.
 - this is from the USB core, not from mass storage
 - USB core issues a clear halt on configuration or alternate interface setting changes

DMA mask patch
 - may have more feedback from Andy
 - Sarah to staighten this out - Xenia to send patch to me, then we see what needs to be done
