Xenia:
 - create a rough outline of the talk, put in git repo.

Sarah:
 - look into clear halt issue: infinite loop on next clear halt


Notes:
-------

OPW five-minute talk outline suggestion:
 - experiences with the program, what you learned about, what was good and what needs improvement
 - technical topics:
   - what is dynamic debugging? how it helps (i.e. don't need a separate CONFIG flag)
   - what are trace events?  talk about adding them to xHCI
 - advice to future OPW interns

Xenia says the clear halt issue is not related to xHCI endpoint state (which
are zeroed) or the xhci_virt_ep variables stopped_trb and stopped_td (which are
NULL).
