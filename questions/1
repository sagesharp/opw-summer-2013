Hi Sarah,

In xhci.h, the macro used for setting the stream context type:

#define    SCT_FOR_CTX(p)        (((p) << 1) & 0x7)

maybe it does not do what you want. Because if you want to
set the stream context type to  SCT_SSA_256 (=7) and you
use the above macro you will take 0110 (in binary).

I don't know, is that what you want or 1110 ?

This macro is used only in this part in the driver:

addr = cur_ring->first_seg->dma |
            SCT_FOR_CTX(SCT_PRI_TR) |
            cur_ring->cycle_state;
stream_info->stream_ctx_array[cur_stream].stream_ring =
            cpu_to_le64(addr);

in xhci_alloc_stream_info()

So it won't trigger a problem, but if in the future
support for Secondary Stream Arrays is added then there
will be problem if SCT is not set properly.
