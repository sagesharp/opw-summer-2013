Hi Sarah,

In function xhci_alloc_stream_ctx() defined in xhci-mem.c i cannot
understand the following:

pdev=to_pci_dev(dev) function is called in order to take a pointer to the
pci_dev struct that contains the generic struct device dev.

And then the code does pdev->dev to take again the generic dev
field of pci_dev struct.

Why it does not use directly dev instead of going back to it through
pci_dev?

Also, will this code work for non-pci platforms because it is pci specific?

I saw this kind of use of pci_dev struct and in other parts in xhci-mem.c
