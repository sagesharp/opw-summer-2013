Hi Sarah,

In function xhci_calculate_lpm_timeout() in xhci.c, i see
that the code loops through the entire config->interface[] array.

for (i = 0; i < USB_MAXINTERFACES; i++) {

I think it would be more efficient to loop through the
number of interfaces that are actually supported by
the given configuration. I mean to do:

for (i = 0; i < config->desc.bNumInterfaces; i++) {

because it is "guaranteed" that interfaces will be stored
sequentially into this array.

And i say "guaranteed" because this is the way used
across the usb/core/usb.c to traverse the interface
array of a given configuration.

That will save you unnecessary loop cycles since most
configurations come with 1-2 interfaces and the
USB_MAXINTERFACES is 32.
