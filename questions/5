Hi Sarah,

When running checkpatch script on xhci.c it is produced the
following warning:

WARNING: msleep < 20ms can sleep for up to 20ms;
see Documentation/timers/timers-howto.txt
+	msleep(10);

The implementation of msleep() is based on jiffies timeout
subsystem. Hence, its resolution is constrained by the value
of HZ tick rate. When HZ variable is configured to 100 (the
most common), the jiffies variable is updated every 10 ms.

void msleep(unsigned int msecs)
{
         unsigned long timeout = msecs_to_jiffies(msecs) + 1;

         while (timeout)
                 timeout = schedule_timeout_uninterruptible(timeout);
}

The timeout for msecs = 10 will be two, so the msleep will sleep for
up to 20ms (if it was called write after the jiffies variable was updated)

Because timeout = ((m + (MSEC_PER_SEC / HZ) - 1) / (MSEC_PER_SEC / HZ)) + 1 =
                = ((m + 10 - 1) / 10) + 1 = 2

If you want precision maybe it is better here to use hrtimers via
usleep_range() that provide microsecond-level resolution.
