Add a new trace point for print statements relating to resetting an endpoint.

An endpoint reset happens when a USB device answers with a STALL packet to a
transfer.  This means the host should not talk to the device until it clears
the STALL, by sending a USB control transfer.  The xHCI host also needs to know
the endpoint has been reset, so the xHCI driver issues a command to it.

Functions:
 - xhci_endpoint_reset in xhci.c
 - handle_reset_ep_completion in xhci-ring.c
